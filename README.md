## BloodHound Query Legacy to CE Tool

### Convert and Upload Custom Queries from BloodHound Legacy to BloodHound CE

This tool simplifies the process of migrating/converting your Cypher queries from **Legacy BloodHound** to **BloodHound CE (Community Edition)**. It automatically reformats legacy custom queries into the new BloodHound CE format and uploads them directly through the BloodHound CE API.

### Key Features
- Convert BloodHound Legacy queries to the BloodHound CE JSON format.
- Automatically upload reformatted queries to BloodHound CE via API.
- Support for rate-limited uploading to prevent API blocking.
- Detailed error handling and progress reporting during query uploads.

**Update 12/01/2025 - Improved Script Features:**
- Missing `category` is set to `null` automatically instead of causing an error.
- Missing query `name` is assigned a unique name in the format: `Unnamed query <uuid>`.
- Queries with missing or empty query values are skipped with a message indicating why.
- Fetches variables in `props` field, and replaces them in the query to be compatible with BloodHound CE.
- Skips Queries with more than 1 query value to avoid errors.
- Logs failed uploads in failed_uploads.txt and skipped queries in skipped_queries.txt.

#### Convert and Upload Custom Queries

This command converts custom queries from the Legacy BloodHound format and uploads them directly to BloodHound CE using your JWT token.

```bash
python upload_bloodhound_queries.py --input-file bloodhound_legacy_customqueries.json --jwt-token YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

#### Convert Only (Save to File Without Uploading)

This command converts custom queries without uploading them. The output is saved to a file in the new BloodHound CE format.

```bash
python upload_bloodhound_queries.py --input-file bloodhound_legacy_customqueries.json --convert-only --output-file newformat_customqueries.json
```
#### Upload Already Converted Custom Queries

If you already have custom queries in the new BloodHound CE format and only need to upload them, use the `--upload-only` flag. This skips the conversion step:

```bash
python upload_bloodhound_queries.py --upload-only --input-file converted_custom_queries.json --jwt-token YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```
#### Upload to a Different BloodHound CE API URL

By default, the tool uses `http://localhost:8080/api/v2/saved-queries` as the API endpoint. If your BloodHound CE instance runs on a different port or URL, use the `--api-url` flag to customize:

```bash
python upload_bloodhound_queries.py --input-file newformat_customqueries.json \
                                    --jwt-token YOUR_JWT_TOKEN \
                                    --api-url "http://your-server:your-port/api/v2/saved-queries"
```

## Getting the JWT Token from BloodHound CE

To upload queries via the API, you'll need the **JWT token** from BloodHound CE. Here's how to get it:

1.  Open BloodHound CE and navigate to the **API Explorer**.
2.  Find the **Get Self** API request, click **Try It Out**, then **Execute**.

3.  Once the response loads, grab the **JWT Token** located in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

## Old vs New Query Format

This tool converts the custom queries from **Legacy BloodHound** to the **BloodHound CE** JSON format automatically. Here‚Äôs an example of what that looks like:

### Legacy BloodHound Format:

```json
{
    "queries": [
        {
            "name": "Query Name",
            "category": "Category",
            "queryList": [
                { 
                "final": true, 
                "query": "MATCH (n) RETURN n" 
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### BloodHound CE Format:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Query Name",
        "category": "Category",
        "query": "MATCH (n) RETURN n"
    }
]
```

You no longer need to handle this manually! Just use the tool, and it will handle the conversion for you.
